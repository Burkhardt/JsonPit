# Future Work for JsonPit

## Vision
We envision expanding the functionality of JsonPit to include a server application that provides seamless access to the internal values of a JsonPit stored with a CloudStorage service. This will involve creating deep URLs for complete PitItem objects, individual properties, and media file references like images, videos, and PDFs.

## Objectives

### 1. Server Application
Develop a server application that interfaces with JsonPit, providing robust and scalable access to stored data.

#### Key Features:
- **RESTful API**: Create endpoints for CRUD operations on PitItem objects.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement secure access controls to ensure data privacy and integrity.
- **Scalability**: Design the server to handle large volumes of requests efficiently.

### 2. Deep URL Access
Enable deep linking to various components within a JsonPit.

#### Features:
- **Complete PitItem Object Access**: Provide URLs that return the entire PitItem as JSON.
- **Single Property Access**: Allow access to individual properties of a PitItem via URL.
- **Media File References**: Generate URLs for media files stored within the JsonPit.

### 3. Advanced Query Capabilities
Enhance the server application with advanced query features.

#### Features:
- **Filter and Search**: Implement filtering and searching capabilities for PitItem objects.
- **Historical Data Access**: Allow retrieval of historical data and changes over time.

### 4. Integration with CloudStorage Services
Ensure seamless integration with various CloudStorage services.

#### Features:
- **Synchronization**: Implement synchronization mechanisms to keep JsonPit data up-to-date across different storage services.
- **Backup and Restore**: Develop features for backing up and restoring JsonPit data.

### 5. Media Handling
Improve media file management within JsonPit.

#### Features:
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for media files to optimize performance.
- **Media Metadata**: Provide access to metadata for media files stored within JsonPit.

### 6. User Interface
Create a user-friendly interface for managing and accessing JsonPit data.

#### Features:
- **Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard for visualizing and managing PitItem objects.
- **Data Visualization**: Implement data visualization tools for better insights into stored data.

## Conclusion
These future enhancements aim to make JsonPit a more powerful and user-friendly tool for managing structured data in the cloud. By developing a server application, enabling deep URL access, and improving media handling, we can provide a robust and scalable solution for our users.
